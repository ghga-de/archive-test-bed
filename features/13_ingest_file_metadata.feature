Feature: 13 Ingest File Metadata
  As a data steward, I can output metadata files to the file ingest service

  Scenario: Ingesting file metadata

    Given we have the state "Files uploaded successfully"

    When file metadata is ingested
    Then we have the file accessions
    And file metadata exist in "ifrs" collection "file_metadata"
    And files exist in permanent bucket
    And set the state to "File metadata ingested successfully"
